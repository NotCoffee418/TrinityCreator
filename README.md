This tool allows you to easily create items, creatures and quests for WoW emulators.  
Trinity Creator can be used by beginners to learn emulator server customization and by experts who just want to do it easier and faster.

### Preview ###
[![Trinity Creator Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9306304/83597121-c21ab980-a566-11ea-980b-0163f1dd7518.png "Item Creator")](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9306304/83596693-921ee680-a565-11ea-87c2-9d975710b577.png)

### Getting started ###
* [Download & install the latest version](https://github.com/Nadromar/TrinityCreator/blob/master/TrinityCreatorSetup/bin/Release/TrinityCreatorSetup.msi?raw=true)
* Use the top menu to select your emulator
* Enter your database info & DBC directory (optional, adds extra features)
* Start creating!
NOTE: You need to reload tables or restart your server before you can see your new creation.

### Currently supported emulators ###
* TrinityCore WotLK 3.3.5a (2020-01 database)
* TrinityCore WotLK 3.3.5a (2016-06 database)
* Light's Hope Emulator 1.12.2 (Brotalnia repack v16)
* VMaNGOS 1.12.2 (Brotalnia Repack v17)

***V1.1 Update:*** You can add support for any emulator as long as it's WotLK or lower, by using the Profile Creator tool.  
Making edits to existing profiles for slightly newer or older versions of a specific emulator has also been made easy.

Known issues: There are specific fields set up for 1.12 emulators as well. But you may have issues with Cataclysm and newer versions of WoW.

You can contribute any profiles you create at [NotCoffe418/TrinityCreatorProfiles](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/TrinityCreatorProfiles).
